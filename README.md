> Making common algorithms, data structures, other stuff in as many different languages as possible.

# Todo
- Add Top function to py and cpp stacks
- Test Dequeue for queues
- Add sort functions for linked lists
- Add searching functions for linked lists and bst
- Complete merge and quick sort algorithms
- Make proper documentation for all
- Create `std::cout` like stacking of the `<<` operator for push/add/insert(bst)/enqueue for easy use.
