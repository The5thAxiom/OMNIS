# What is sorting
The process of arranging the elements of an array in sequential order.
# Types of sorting algorithms
### Bubble Sort
- Go through the array and compare each pair as you go along, and rearrange them.
- Keep going through until the array is sorted.
- Very inefficient: O()
### Selection Sort
